A few notes regarding working with the source tree:

 - run everything through gofmt before committing.
 - Sometimes it makes sense to punt on doing a particular thing properly in
   order to not get sidetracked. (I've learned this the hard way.) This is
   okay, but DO NOT let it get into a release. If you know you're being lazy
   about something, or deferring stuff that matters until later, document it.
   I use the following to make sure I don't forget stuff like this:

   - If an expected piece of functionality is outright missing, write a comment,
     which should include the string TODO somewhere

   - If something is broken, i.e. it doesn't work under some circumstances (Or
     you think it *might* not), use FIXME.

   Nothing goes in a release with one of these tags. In general, I won't pull
   code that has these in HEAD from others. I'm fine with them being in the
   history, but clean up your mess before giving it to me. (You'll notice that
   I have my own mess sometimes, too. when we actually have a release
   proceedure I'll make sure to keep my awful hacks away from it as well.)

 - Wherever possible, don't write subtle code. Where it isn't possible,
   document the subtlety clearly. If this results in a lot of comments, your
   code is too subtle.

 - It should not be possible for a reasonable person to have to guess as to
   what you were getting at when writing something. commit messages are a good
   place to document higher level "This is what I was trying to do and here's
   where I'm going with it."
